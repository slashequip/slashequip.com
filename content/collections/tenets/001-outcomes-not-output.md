title: 'Focus on outcomes, not output'
summary: "Too often we focus on working more, or shipping more. The reality is it's not about more of everything or anything - it's about more positive outcomes."
body: |-
  At Hospitable, we often talk about how fast we ship for a small team, and we straight up do - the engineering team is 25 strong, powering billions in guest bookings for our hosts, shipping up to 52 times a day (our 2026 record so far).

  We don't always get it right, far from it. But when we do, it's because we've focused on outcomes, not output. You can have both - but when we get it wrong, it's almost always because we chased output and ignored outcomes.
