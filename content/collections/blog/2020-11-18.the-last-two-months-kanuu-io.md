title: 'The last two months; Kanuu.io'
intro: '<p><em>TL;DR I spent the last two months working on a new product called Kanuu. It can be found here; <a href="https://kanuu.io/?ref=slashequip.ghost.io">kanuu.io</a>. It&#039;s a product that provides you with a subscription UI so you can focus on building your product and not maintaining billing stuff.</em></p>'
