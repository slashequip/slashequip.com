We're treating a revolutionary technology with less patience than we'd give to learning something like Go or Ruby."

        text: "The impatience seems logical. We're communicating with AI in natural language - the same way we've expressed ourselves since we were children. But this surface-level familiarity masks something deeper; prompting AI effectively is its own form of syntax, with rules, patterns, and best practices that require practice."

We start with some basic syntax, progressing to understand its paradigms, and discover its strengths and limitations. We expect to write mediocre code initially, something breaks, and then we learn from our mistakes. Yet with AI, many programmers skip this learning phase entirely, expecting flawless output from their first prompt - '

Instead, we learn its nuance, understand its bounds, and develop strategies to work effectively within its constraints. Similarly, AI requires us to understand its \"type system\" equivalent - what kinds of prompts work best, how to structure our requests, and when to use different approaches."

        text: "The most successful engineers I've see in the wild are treating AI like any other tool in their arsenal. They maintain prompts like they would code snippets. They are aware of successful patterns and failed attempts. They approach edge cases methodically, testing different prompt structures to understand what works and why. This isn't different from how we debug code or optimize our database queries."

This means enabling teams to experiment, share findings, and build institutional knowledge about effective AI interactions.'

After all, the best engineers aren't those who expect perfection - they're those who perfect their ability to leverage the tools around them."
