        text: "All these decisions are taxing, they take their toll throughout the day. Some are more taxing than others but what I've come to realize is that every decision saps our energy. Once our decision-energy has been taken the mental fog creeps in and work becomes harder, even simple tasks end up being way more complex than they should."
