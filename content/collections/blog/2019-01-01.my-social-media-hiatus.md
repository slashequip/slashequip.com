        text: "About a year or so ago now I'd noticed a habit-forming; every morning I'd wake up when my alarm went off, the first thing I'd do was check Facebook, then Instagram, then Twitter. Sometimes I'd go back to Facebook to see if anyone had posted anything in the last 10 minutes. What the crap am I doing with my life?"

This morning habit I had noticed started making more aware. I caught myself checking my phone every 20-30 minutes throughout the day some times even more often - Facebook was the worst for this."

Instagram I put into retirement, I didn't want to fully delete as I had some nice pictures of my daughter on there that my family can see. Then there was Twitter, honestly, I didn't delete Twitter it's too intertwined with the development industry, I felt like I'd genuinely get a little left behind if I just deleted it, so I left it but what I did do was to remove all social apps from my phone, so I wouldn't get reminders anymore or see the little notification count icon next to the app."
